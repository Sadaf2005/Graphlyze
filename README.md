# Graphlyze-Graph-algorithms-visualiser

Graphlyze is an interactive tool designed to visually demonstrate popular graph algorithms, helping users better understand complex graph theory concepts.

This project succesfully displays three main graph algorithms :-
1.Depth First Search
2.Breadth First Search 
3.Minimum Spanning Tree


1.DEPTH FIRST SEARCH : Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. Starting from a source node, DFS visits each node by moving to an unvisited adjacent node until it reaches a dead end, then backtracks to explore other unvisited paths.

2.BREADTH FIRST SEARCH : Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level. Starting from a source node, BFS visits all adjacent nodes (neighbors) before moving to the next level of nodes. It uses a queue to track the nodes to be explored next. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, checking for bipartiteness, and solving problems like finding connected components.

3.MINIMUM SPANNING TREE : A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of edges from a connected, weighted graph that connects all the vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight and no cycles. In other words, it spans all vertices and has the least total edge cost.
